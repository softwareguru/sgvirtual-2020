I am a PhD Researcher in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, based in the School of Computer Science and part of the Mixed Reality Lab.

My area of research is Human Computer Interaction (HCI). My PhD focuses on technology use by people with visual impairments and the methods they employ to accomplish everyday activities, to uncover peopleâ€™s competencies that could inform and support accessible technology design. I am also interested in how voice technologies are or could be used to improve accessibility. 

I hold a MSc in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Nottingham in the UK and a BSc in Computer Systems Engineering from the Pachuca Institute of Technology in Mexico. I also have experience in the tech industry in Mexico, as Web Developer at Sargon Systems and more recently as Business Analyst/Product Owner at Scio Consulting.
