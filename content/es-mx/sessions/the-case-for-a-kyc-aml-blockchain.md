While blockchain technology has been linked in our collective imaginarium to crypto-currencies and obscure transactions down deep in the dark web, the underlying ideas that support blockchain are still to be leveraged to create public networks that can provide confirmation of transactions across different industries. One example is the current regulatory request for all banks to provide information about all transactions to the Central Bank in Mexico, which will create an infrastructure nightmare and a single point of failure for all banks. Instead, blockchain technology could be leveraged to create an open network under regulatory overview to prevent money laundering and get banks to understand better who their customers are.
