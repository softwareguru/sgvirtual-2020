This talk is for mobile engineers that have experience with Swift or Kotlin for iOS and Android We will cover the getting started guide for all the developers that are interested in moving to Kotlin Multiplatform as a production-ready tool, taking into consideration all the pitfalls and advantages we can have using it, we will cover some simple clever things you can do with Ktor and SQLiteDelight to simplify modularization, take advantages of Serialization, and the terrific world of Kotlin Multiplatform. Talking about how to shape your architecture for a production app, and sharing your architecture, without leaving behind the OS, the security and the performance of your app, sometimes we forgot that for a good production app we need a good architecture that is testable, that is taking consideration of concurrency and databases.
