Onboarding new members into an engineering team is not easy on anyone. In a short period of time, the new team member is required to be able to bring professional value and become an impactful member on the one hand, and on the other hand — to be an integral part of the team’s and the company’s culture.

When the new member is the only one of its gender on the team, we need to make sure that we have a bias-aware environment. In this talk I provide tips and examples on how to build a bias-aware environment, where new team members will feel welcome and will be able to focus on doing great engineering.
