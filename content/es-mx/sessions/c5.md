Oracle APEX on Autonomous Database provides a preconfigured, fully managed and secured environment to both develop and deploy world-class applications. Oracle takes care of configuration, tuning, backups, patching, encryption, scaling and more, leaving you free to focus on solving your business problems. This session was developed with assistance of Oracle Solution Center Mexico Team.
Join us for review:

* What is the autonomous database?
* How you can develop an app with APEX?

"We are using machine learning to make our software autonomous and smarter." Larry E.
