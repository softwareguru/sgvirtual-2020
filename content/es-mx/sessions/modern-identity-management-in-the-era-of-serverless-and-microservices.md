If you believe that Identity Management (IdM) is just related with the Authentication and Authorization processes, this is a talk for you.\
\
IdM is an umbrella term for all of the core logic around identity. That means manage provisioning (assigning identities to users), account management (maintaining those identities), identity governance (assigning them to groups and roles and adjusting permissions as needed), authentication, authorization, identity federation (ensuring users can use the same identification data to access resources on related domains). A login is more than a Single Sign On, we can use Passwordless, Federated Identity (FB, GitHub), Multifactor Authentication, improving our users experience.\
\
The main purpose of this talk is gain an in-depth knowledge of those terms, in addition explore some PaaS, that can help to achieve all that in our projects easier and faster.
