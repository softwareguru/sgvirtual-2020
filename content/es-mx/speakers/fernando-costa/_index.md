Experience over 18 years in software development, products and services in various segments: payroll, tax, tax and public administration management

In addition to the above, I have in-depth knowledge of ITSM, ITIL and Cobit. I led the development of two products certified in Incident, Problem, Configuration and Change Management by PinkElephant.

I have skills in budget management, KPI review, business plan development, technical team management, corporate governance and solution architecture and enterprise software development.

Today my main role is to help clients with technological solutions that range from AI implementations to secure cloud integrations.
