I am originally from MÃ©xico City. I currently work as a senior engineer at One Degree, a non-profit in San Francisco which provides a platform for low income families and individuals to easily access social services. I have a great passion for data engineering and bring these skills to my current job. On the side, I have created a data engineering community where we spread the word about data engineering in Latin America.
