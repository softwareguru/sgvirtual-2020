#### Who am I?
I'm Jimmy Morales, a family guy, curious nerd and soccer obsessed (or at least that's what I want in my epitaph).

#### Hobbies
I like to read a lot about software and technology but I like more to share with my local community. I'm a co-organizer in the GDG Guatemala community.
I also love to be the father of a 1 year old beautiful girl.
And, of course, I'm a FC Barcelona fan and like to play soccer ocassionally (I screwed my knee :D)
