15+ years getting things done, crafting impactful and measurable software solutions, and building strong teams with amazing people.

Data-driven, goal-oriented, world-class systems with accessibility, full-stack mobile and web development, security, testing, telemetry and automation.

Great communicator (English and Spanish), writer and passionate about leadership topics and career development. I like helping customers achieve more, stakeholders be more effective and fellow engineers become more productive, empowered and happier.

Experienced with a plethora of technologies including Java, C# / .net, Android, JavaScript, React, React Native, TypeScript, Postgres, and others. Tech is the tool, processes are a medium, but building things that delight and solve problems whilst having fun and strengthening relationships is the goal.
